## The real problem we would like to solve

based on user-provided GPS coordinates, we would like to display the closest-placed nursery schools in Brno.
Applying for the closest available nursery school decreases spending on fuel, which may positively benefit the economy of
local households. Shorter traveling distances cause a decrease in energy spending, which may increase air quality and,
therefore, the health of local citizens. The service is expected to simplify parents' lives by decreasing the time required
to search for a suitable nursery school. Since parents are usually people at a productive age, increasing the amount of free time
will enable them to invest more time into economically productive activities. As a byproduct, it is supposed to increase local GDP.

### What datasets will we need:

[dataset url](https://data.brno.cz/datasets/f7b8d8d9beb54b158a6bcd25b8b902da_0/explore?location=49.202213%2C16.592108%2C10.66&showTable=true)
(the dataset is expected to update since the enrolment into nursery schools is still ongoing)

### Potential customers:

Residents of Brno with children of preschool age.
